    <h1>My Favorite Sport: Bowling</h1>
    <p>Bowling is a sport I enjoy both competitively and recreationally. It requires focus, technique, and consistency. I participated on my school's varsity team, which helped me grow as a competitor and teammate.</p>

    <h2>Why I Like Bowling</h2>
    <p>It combines precision with fun. Every game is different, and small improvements make a big difference. Practicing taught me patience and discipline, and competitions gave me confidence.</p>
